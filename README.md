# Barren Plateau

Simulate the phenomenon of the barren plateau.

## Introduction

The "barren plateau" refers to a challenge in training parameterized quantum circuits, where gradients become tiny or vanish, hindering optimization progress. It poses a significant obstacle to effectively training quantum circuits for tasks like optimization or machine learning.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install -r barren/requirements.txt
```
